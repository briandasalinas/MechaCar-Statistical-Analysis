## Purpose

## Results
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Vehicle length provided the 
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- Looking at the summary with the 3 lots combined the variance of the suspension coils do not exceed 100 pounds per square inch meeting the design specification for MechaCar. But once we look at the data by individual lots, Lot 3 is the only lot that does not comply in the variance of the suspension coils, having the variance at 170.3. Population data vs sample data can give different numbers due to the size of the data. 

### T-Tests on Suspension Coils
- briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.
